# technical-discussion
this is a repository created to explain somethings around .md extensions and text formatation to technical discussion
 
 To create a head, we use # at the begin of the word
 (at the first line, I wrote # technical discussion)
 
 using ##, we can create a second heading:
 
 ## This is a second heading. With *, we can make lists: 
 * one
 * two 
 * three

### Gist
